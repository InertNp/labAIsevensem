# Lab Setup Instructions

## Setup Environment

Before running any labs, make sure to set up the environment. Follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Labs

After setting up the environment, you can run any lab by using the following command:

- To run Lab 1:
    ```bash
    python lab1.py
    ```

- To run Lab 2:
    ```bash
    python lab2.py
    ```

- To run Lab 3:
    ```bash
    python lab3.py
    ```

- To run Lab 4:
    ```bash
    python lab4.py
    ```

- To run Lab 5:
    ```bash
    python lab5.py
    ```

- To run Lab 6:
    ```bash
    python lab6.py
    ```

- To run Lab 7:
    ```bash
    python lab7.py
    ```

- To run Lab 8:
    ```bash
    python lab8.py
    ```

- To run Lab 9:
    ```bash
    python lab9.py
    ```

- To run Lab 10:
    ```bash
    python lab10.py
    ```

Just replace the script name (`labX.py`) with the corresponding lab file you wish to run.

Happy Coding!
